# FuckPSSE  

To install:  
    Add FuckPSSE.suprx to \*ALL  
  
when you run a PSM game, the screen will go RED.. While the screen is RED. the game files are being dumped  
  
There is no progess indicaton (doing pretty much anything requires aditional DLL's that the game might not have)  
  
however. once it is done, the screen will go GREEN at this point you can close out of the game.  
and look in the ux0:/PSM/<TITLEID>/Documents/ folder and there will be a complete (Now decrypted) mirror of the Application/ folder.  
  
If you wanna use it in the PSM Simulator. i found it doesnt like me if i keep the original .edata file, so you may have to rename that  
  
  
What this will enable:  
1) PSM Game/Application Modding  
2) Inspecting PSM Game/Application files  
3) Running retail PSM Games/Applications in the PSM Simulator  
4) Reverse Engineering of PSM Games/Applications  
5) Probably more things too  
6) Run Retail PSM Games in the PSM Developer App (LOL)  
  
What this will NOT enable  
1) Vita Game Emulation (no. j-just stop the simulator isnt even emulating anything)  
2) Running PSM games you dont have a license for (dumper requires you to *RUN* the game in the first place!)  
3) PSM Dev or PSM Unity applications.
